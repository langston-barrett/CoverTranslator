# CoverTranslator

This is the work presented in the paper paper 
["Verifying Haskell Programs Using Constructive Type Theory"][paper]. 
It is unmodified, and so incompatible with Agda 2.

All credit is due to the authors, the participants in the CoverTranslator
project. I host this code only because their website is now non-existent.
